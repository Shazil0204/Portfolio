      Technically, React is often referred to as a library rather than a
      framework. This distinction can sometimes be a bit blurry, but here's the
      main difference: Framework: A framework typically provides a complete
      structure for building applications. It often dictates the architecture of
      your application and requires you to follow certain conventions. Examples
      include Angular and Ember.js. Library: A library, on the other hand, is a
      collection of reusable code that you can use to perform specific tasks. It
      doesn't enforce any particular structure on your application. React falls
      into this category because it focuses on providing a way to create user
      interfaces and manage state, but it doesn't dictate how you structure your
      entire application. That said, React is sometimes colloquially referred to
      as a "framework" due to its comprehensive set of tools and ecosystem that
      can handle various aspects of application development, such as routing
      (with React Router), state management (with Redux or React Context), and
      server-side rendering (with Next.js). But technically, React itself is
      more accurately described as a library.
